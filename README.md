# Labyrinth-Clash


It is supposed to be a deck builder. It is a four player game where the players fight each other and the game ends when one player has killed each of the others once. It takes place in a labyrinth with monsters and loot hidden throughout. All loot, whether dropped by a chest or a monster is a card that may be added to the players deck. Cards cost resources and make resources and do special things. The resources are DEX, STR, INT, HOL, the 4 players are a Mage, a Warrior, a Rogue, and a Cleric. The board is made up of square tiles that are initially face down and are turned face up when they are discovered as an action from a neighboring tile. When a tile is turned face up a token is taken from a bag and whatever that token represents is what's on the tile, either a monster or a loot container. The warrior is strong having access to more strength cards. He uses mostly swords and brute force to conquer his foes. The rogue is sneaky and dexterous, he can become hidden and strike from the shadows, he uses bows. The cleric uses holiness to appease god and use His power to enact justice on the evil among him. The mage uses magic to cast powerful spells to harm others or change the battlefield in strange ways.
