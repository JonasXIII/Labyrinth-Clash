# Basic Turn
1. Take [[Actions]] - play cards from hand
2. [[Movement|move]] or [[Actions#Rest|rest]]
3. Draw [[Cards]] 
	* How many?
	* Default of 5
		* additional cards though cantrips, special items, or class passives

# Stages

## ((Moving or Resting) and Attacking)

We haven't decided on any limitations about this stage of your turn.
Should movement happen all at once; can you move, attack, and then move again?


## Drawing Cards
We are thinking that cards should be drawn at the end of your turn
* Since you might want to use cards during an opponent's turn, drawing at the end means you don't have to budget your cards during your turn.
* It gives you more time to plan your next turn as you have information about your hand earlier.
