Cards might be tied to what actions there


# Ideas For Kinds of Cards
## Movement Cards
Related to [[Movement|movement]]
Spend one card to move one tile / explore one tile.
* These cards are the resource that allow movement?

## Attack Cards
Cards that can be used to attack or defend against attacks.
* These cards are the resource that allows you to attack / defend?

## Exhaustion Cards
Cards that are accumulated performing actions that exert the hero. They go straight into your discard pile and act as dead weight in your deck. 

You can take a [[Actions#Rest|rest action]] to remove some exhaustion cards from your deck. This adds an interesting trade-off between taking bold actions now, but having reduced action economy later as a result.

## Weapon/Equipment Cards
Don't have any effect on their own, but when played in conjunction with an attack /movement card, have some other effect?
* Bows let you do ranged attacks
* Swords add +1 to your weapon attack
* Shields add +1
* Lock pick lets you move with only one adjacent door

## Special Action Cards
Cards that allow you to take some other action on your turn
* Drawing Cards
* Healing
* Casing spells of some kind

# Class-Based Card Effects
We think it is important that every ability/card is usable by every player, however, cards that align with your class can be combined/buffed in more interesting ways.

This could add more variation in the playstyles between classes. A mage could build a deck focusing on ranged attacks, but it wouldn't be nearly as effective as in the hands of a [[Classes#Ranger|ranger]]
## Examples/Ideas:
* Everyone can use a shield card for +1 defense, but the [[Classes#Warrior|warrior]] can use it for +2 defense
	* Maybe the warrior can also use the shield as an attack card
* Everyone can use the "bow" card to attack an adjacent tile instead of just the current tile, but the [[Classes#Ranger|ranger]] is the only class that can stack them to attack longer lines of sight.
* Everyone can use a "room swap" card to swap two rooms, but only the mage can swap a room with a hero in it.
* Everyone can use the "sneak" card to walk through tiles that only share one door, but the [[Classes#Rogue|rogue]] can use it to walk through walls that share no doors.

# Combo Cards
We should try to think of interesting combos that could be pulled off within each class

On the flip side, we should think about how each class can counter other class abilities
* One example is the mage using a reaction to rotate a room to block a line of sight, so the ranger can't attack.
