Cards might be tied to what actions there


# Kinds of Cards

## Resource Cards
Each of these cards has a value for each of the [[Stats]]
You can play a resource card and spend the points on that  card to perform some action. When playing a resource card, you must chose which stat you are using it for.

Action types: This is bad because it means that rangers would be the best at moving.
* Str: Attack?
* Dex: Move?
* Vit: Heal?
* Int: ??

## Equipment Cards
Equipment cards let you add bonuses to resource cards. 
They have a value for some of the stats and allow you to add that number to a resource card when you play it.

## Action Cards
A

## Exhaustion Cards
Cards that are accumulated performing actions that exert the hero. They go straight into your discard pile and act as dead weight in your deck. 

You can take a [[Actions#Rest|rest action]] to remove some exhaustion cards from your deck. This adds an interesting trade-off between taking bold actions now, but having reduced action economy later as a result.

# Ideas
## Totally Awesome New Idea
### Experience Cards
* Have a value for each of the 4 [[Stats]]s
* Every hero starts with cards specializing in their [[Stats]]
* Unclear how we add Experience cards relevant to the specific hero
	* maybe each hero has passive to always +1 to their [[Stats]]
### Equipment Cards
* Give a plus to some [[Stats]](s)
	* +0/+0/+1/+2
	* +1/+1/+1/+0
	* +5/+0/+0/+0
### Action Cards
* do cool thing
	* teleport
	* shoot special arrow
* Cost some number of [[Stats]] points
* might require an Experience card with a minimum value
	* 6 Int(3 from one Experience card)
		* pushes powerful cards more to late game


## Weapon/Equipment Cards
Don't have any effect on their own, but when played in conjunction with an attack /movement card, have some other effect?
* Bows let you do ranged attacks
* Swords add +1 to your weapon attack
* Shields add +1
* Lock pick lets you move with only one adjacent door

## Special Action Cards
Cards that allow you to take some other action on your turn
* Drawing Cards
* Healing
* Casing spells of some kind

# Class-Based Card Effects
We think it is important that every ability/card is usable by every player, however, cards that align with your class can be combined/buffed in more interesting ways.

This could add more variation in the play styles between classes. A mage could build a deck focusing on ranged attacks, but it wouldn't be nearly as effective as in the hands of a [[Classes#Ranger|ranger]]
## Examples/Ideas:
* Everyone can use a shield card for +1 defense, but the [[Classes#Warrior|warrior]] can use it for +2 defense
	* Maybe the warrior can also use the shield as an attack card
* Everyone can use the "bow" card to attack an adjacent tile instead of just the current tile, but the [[Classes#Ranger|ranger]] is the only class that can stack them to attack longer lines of sight.
* Everyone can use a "room swap" card to swap two rooms, but only the mage can swap a room with a hero in it.
* Everyone can use the "sneak" card to walk through tiles that only share one door, but the [[Classes#Rogue|rogue]] can use it to walk through walls that share no doors.

# Combo Cards
We should try to think of interesting combos that could be pulled off within each class

On the flip side, we should think about how each class can counter other class abilities
* One example is the mage using a reaction to rotate a room to block a line of sight, so the ranger can't attack.
