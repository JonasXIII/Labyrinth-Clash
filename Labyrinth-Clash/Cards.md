Cards might be tied to what actions there


# Kinds of Cards

## Resource Cards
Each of these cards has a value for each of the [[Resources]] as well as attack and defense.
You can play a resource card and spend the points on that  card to pay for some action. A  resource card can only pay for one action each time you play it.

## Action Cards
Action cards have some resource cost and allow you to perform some action beyond the basic action. 

Actions could be things like maneuvers, spells, items, or weapons.

### Action Costs
Some actions might have a requirement that one of the cards used to pay for it have a resource value above a given cost. For example, a powerful sword might cost 4 STR with the requirement that one of the cards used to pay for it has 3 ST.
### Ideas:
Instant speed cards?

Casing spells of some kind
* Teleport
* Rotate tiles
* Reawaken monsters
* Counterspells

Drawing Cards

Special Attacks
* Shoot a special bow

Healing
* Heal health
* Block another healing spell

## Exhaustion Cards
Cards that are accumulated performing actions that exert the hero. They go straight into your discard pile and act as dead weight in your deck. 

You can take a [[Actions#Rest|rest action]] to remove some exhaustion cards from your deck. This adds an interesting trade-off between taking bold actions now, but having reduced action economy later as a result.


# Card Tiers

## Common
Common cards are interchangeable commodities that correspond to very common actions like unlocking doors and chests, basic changes to movement or attacking, or simple.

They should form the backbone of a player's early game deck  and will probably relate to most common actions.

## Rare
Rare cards are somewhere between common and legendary. Their effects are more unique and interesting, but they are not as outcome-defining as legendary cards. Common cards are not singular and there is some duplication.  

These cards are an important bridge between common and legendary cards and are most important in the mid and late game. 

## Legendary
Legendary cards have bespoke names and interesting and powerful effects and there is only one of each legendary card. By the end game when the Heros are the most powerful, a small handful of legendary cards will define their playstyle and likely determine the outcome.



# Ideas

## Class-Based Card Effects (Defunct)
We think it is important that every ability/card is usable by every player, however, cards that align with your class can be combined/buffed in more interesting ways.

This could add more variation in the play styles between classes. A mage could build a deck focusing on ranged attacks, but it wouldn't be nearly as effective as in the hands of a [[Classes#Ranger|ranger]]
### Examples/Ideas:
* Everyone can use a shield card for +1 defense, but the [[Classes#Warrior|warrior]] can use it for +2 defense
	* Maybe the warrior can also use the shield as an attack card
* Everyone can use the "bow" card to attack an adjacent tile instead of just the current tile, but the [[Classes#Ranger|ranger]] is the only class that can stack them to attack longer lines of sight.
* Everyone can use a "room swap" card to swap two rooms, but only the mage can swap a room with a hero in it.
* Everyone can use the "sneak" card to walk through tiles that only share one door, but the [[Classes#Rogue|rogue]] can use it to walk through walls that share no doors.


## Equipment Cards (Defunct Idea)
Equipment cards let you add bonuses to resource cards. 
They have a value for some of the stats and allow you to add that number to a resource card when you play it.

An equipment card can't be used to pay for any action without a resource card

Examples:
* Bows let you do ranged attacks
* Swords add +1 to your weapon attack
* Shields add +1
* Lock pick lets you move with only one adjacent door

Some equipment cards might look like this:
* +0/+0/+1/+2
* +1/+1/+1/+0
* +5/+0/+0/+0
