We are thinking that this game should be a deck-building game at its core.
[[Movement]] currently says fixed movement is good, but this really clashes with deck building idea. 

# Starting Deck
Each deck starts out with just 10 [[Cards#Resource Cards|resource cards]] of some kind

Ideas:
* Starting deck could depend on what class you chose.

# Building a Deck
[[Cards]] will be added to the deck as they are found.
In order to be a deck-building game,  we need some card [[Exploration#Drawing Cards|selection mechanism]] while cards are being drawn. Look at top N and keep one is a mechanic that seems artificial but is good for selection and making it feel like strategy matters. 

## Drawing

### Loot X
We are considering the following mechanic:

Whenever you encounter a situation involving card draw, be it [[Monsters]] or [[Chests]], you draw X cards and get to chose one (or none?) of those cards to keep.

X could be determined by the difficulty of the task
* The strength of the monster
* How difficult unlocking the chest is

## Exiling
Part of the deck-building aspect of the game is choosing cards to remove from your deck, which we are casually referring to as exile for now, but this will probably change.

### Cost
#### Equipment Cards and Action Cards
For [[Cards#Equipment Cards|equipment cards]] and [[Cards#Action Cards|action cards]], we are thinking that discarding them might be free
* Dropping a sword on the floor being difficult doesn't make conceptual sense
* Maybe you'd have to leave it out on the ground for others to pick up?

#### Resource Cards
For [[Cards#Resource Cards|resource cards]] we were considering having some cost to discard
* This would allow the game to have a gradual power ramp over time as you can only slowly get rid of weak resource cards
* We talked about theming resource cards as being related to skills and abilities, so casually getting rid of them makes less sense

Cost
* Discard (not exile) a more powerful resource card 
* This card needs to be equal to or better than the card being exiled in all stats
	* Maybe needs to be strictly more powerful than the exiled card in the hero's primary stat to encourage collecting cards aligning with your class
