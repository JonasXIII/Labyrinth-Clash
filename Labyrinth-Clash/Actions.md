# Move 
![[Movement]]

# Attack
You can attack other players (and monsters?)

# Rest
Instead of move on a turn a [[Heroes]] can choose to discard 1 or 2 exhaustion [[Cards]] from their hand.
Love the idea of rest.

# Special Actions
## Reactions
Could there be some cards/actions that can be played at instant speed or just as a reaction?
Too complicated?

## Rescue Actions
There are some cases where the board ends up in a state where certain sections are fully blocked off from the rest of the maze. Having some kind of special rescue action
This feels too top down, maybe board rotation built in. 
## Class Actions?
There could be some actions that each class can take without needing to use a card to do it. This would make the classes more special and vary the play styles more, but could weaken the deck-building aspects of the game. 
Each class has one special action and one passive that we can try to balance to each other class, some classes may have strong passive and weak ability or flipped.
