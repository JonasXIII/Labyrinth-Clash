Basic actions are actions you  can take on any turn 
## Move
[[Movement]] / [[Exploration]]

## Attack
Attacking is related to some kind of [[Cards#Resource Cards|resource]], but we haven't decided what yet.

## Rest
Resting is an action that a hero can take to  remove [[Cards#Exhaustion Cards|exhaustion cards]] from their hand.
We are thinking that you wouldn't be able to move 

# Special Actions

## Card Actions
[[Cards#Action Cards|card actions]]

## Reactions
Could there be some cards/actions that can be played at instant speed or just as a reaction?
Too complicated?

## Rescue Actions
There are some cases where the board ends up in a state where certain sections are fully blocked off from the rest of the maze. Having some kind of special rescue action
This feels too top down, maybe board rotation built in. 
## Class Actions?
There could be some actions that each class can take without needing to use a card to do it. This would make the classes more special and vary the play styles more, but could weaken the deck-building aspects of the game. 
Each class has one special action and one passive that we can try to balance to each other class, some classes may have strong passive and weak ability or flipped.
