# Move 
![[Movement]]

# Attack
You can attack other players (and monsters?)

# Rest
Instead of move on a turn a [[Heroes]] can choose to discard 1 or 2 exhaustion [[Cards]] from their hand.

# Special Actions
## Reactions
Could there be some cards/actions that can be played at instant speed or just as a reaction?

## Rescue Actions
There are some cases where the board ends up in a state where certain sections are fully blocked off from the rest of the maze. Having some kind of special rescue action

## Class Actions?
There could be some actions that each class can take without needing to use a card to do it. This would make the classes more special and vary the play styles more, but could weaken the deck-building aspects of the game.
