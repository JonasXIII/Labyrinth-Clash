## Reactions
Could there be some cards/actions that can be played at any time on any turn if you have the resources to use them.

## Rescue Actions
There are some cases where the board ends up in a state where certain sections are fully blocked off from the rest of the maze. Having some kind of special rescue action
This feels too top down, maybe board rotation built in. 
## Class Actions?
There could be some actions that each class can take without needing to use a card to do it. This would make the classes more special and vary the play styles more, but could weaken the deck-building aspects of the game. 
Each class has one special action and one passive that we can try to balance to each other class, some classes may have strong passive and weak ability or flipped.
