Players can die when their [[Health|health]] runs out.

# Punishment for Death
Upon death, players are sent back to their [[Board#Start Tiles|starting tiles]] and must select a legendary card from their hand (if they have one) and drop int on the tile where they died.

# Reward for Killing Another Hero
There needs to be some reward for killing another hero to reward players for the risk and investment it takes to engage in a fight and to make the game more dynamic.

Reward
* Getting one of the player's card via random draw
	* If decks are optimized by class this might not be good
* Getting rid of exhaustion cards
