# Center Tiles
The center tiles are a special set of tiles (or singular large tile) that start face-up in the center of the board. 

We haven't decided exactly how many tiles will make up the center
* 4 tiles (even sized board)
* 9 tiles (odd sized board)

We might have moving through the center tiles only cost one movement
* Might add an interesting reason to divert through the center in some cases.

# Start Tiles
The board has one starting tile in each of the corners. The starting tile is inset by one tile from the corner so that it has four neighbors. Each start tile corresponds to one of the four [[Classes|classes]] 

# Revealing Tiles
Revealing tiles happens during the process of [[Exploration|exploring]]. Tiles are revealed by a player entering them for the first time.
