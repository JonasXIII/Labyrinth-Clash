## Moving
Each turn, every player starts with one movement. You can turn two DEX points into one movement.

## Discovering New Tiles
[[Exploration]]
Discovering a new tile costs two movement, but you can still do it if you only have one movement left


## Ideas
How is movement as a resource collected
* Some fixed amount per turn
* Based on how many movement cards you draw
* Based on a die roll like in betrayal?
* SOME FIXED PER TURN
* maybe items(boots) give +1 move per turn
* wearing 3 separate pairs of boots is peak game design
* I think default move of 2 would be good where discovering a tile takes 2 movement, but if you only have one movement left you can still discover

Is every room equally easy to move through or do some rooms take more movement?
