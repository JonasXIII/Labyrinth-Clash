You can move when you take the [[Actions#Move|move action]]

Is movement a distinct phase of your turn or 

How is movement as a resource collected
* Some fixed amount per turn
* Based on how many movement cards you draw
* Based on a die roll like in betrayal?
* SOME FIXED PER TURN
* maybe items(boots) give +1 move per turn
* wearing 3 separate pairs of boots is peak game design
* I think default move of 2 would be good where discovering a tile takes 2 movement, but if you only have one movement left you can still discover

Is every room equally easy to move through or do some rooms take more movement?

Is discovering a room as easy as just moving to it? 
* Maybe it takes two movement to do that
