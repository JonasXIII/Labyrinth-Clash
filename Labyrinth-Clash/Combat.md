Combat is how heros will [[Killing & Dying|kill]] the other heros to [[Objective|win the game]].

## Combat Basics
A player declares an attack by indicating which player they would like to attack and then playing the cards they are using to pay for attack points.
The defender may then chose to play cards to pay for defense points. 
The result of combat is determined by whether the defender has the same number of more defense points as the attacker.

If the defender loses, they take an amount of damage equal to the difference of attack and defense points. If the attacker loses, nothing happens.


## Attack Range
By default, attack points can only be used on a player in the same room. Some cards give attack points that can be used with some range.
